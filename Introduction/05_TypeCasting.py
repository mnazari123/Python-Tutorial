# Type Casting is the ability to convert the data types of a value to another data type

x = 1 # int
y = 2.0 # float; 
z = "3" # string 

# int(y) adding the type before the data and adding the data inside the paranthesis 
# float(x), float(z) 
# str(x), str(z)

print (x)
print (int(y))
print (int(z)*3)


# it is important when a string type is printed next to float or intiger type
# we need to convert first then it will be printable.
